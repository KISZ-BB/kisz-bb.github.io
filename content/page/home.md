The ***Künstliche Intelligenz Service Zentrum für  Berlin-Brandengurg*** (KISZ-BB) is one of four service centers for artificial intelligence (AI) in Germany.  We are funded by the [German Federal Ministry of Science and Research](https://www.bundesregierung.de/breg-en/federal-government/ministries/federal-ministry-of-education). Our  goal is to make AI technology accessible and affordable for everyone.

We tackle societal issues like education, climate change, healthcare, governance, medicine, and manufacturing. We foster collaboration between basic research, applied science, and businesses. This setup encourages the growth of entrepreneurial innovation, especially among start-ups.
