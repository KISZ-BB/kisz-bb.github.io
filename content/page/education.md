## Introduction to Practical Artificial Intelligence
In collaboration with [Mittelstand Digital Zentrum Berlin at HPI](https://digitalzentrum-berlin.de/), KISZ provides a practical and business-oriented introduction to artificial intelligence. We cover basic concepts and applications using real use cases.

We use  five levels of professionalization to structure our professional workshops.

### First Professionalization Level Workshop Topics:

- **AI Business Models:** Understand AI's use in various industries and business contexts.
- **Development - Design Sprint:** Employ iterative, collaborative methods for AI project development.
- **Iteration - Design Sprint:** Use feedback loops and iterative processes for AI application improvement.

### Level 2: AI Infrastructure and Tools
Second level workshops focus on developing and applying AI models and pipelines for problem-solving and decision-making.

**Topics include:**

- **AI Infrastructure Selection:** Evaluate whether to purchase AI-suitable infrastructure or use cloud services. Consider training-to-inference ratio.
- **Tool Selection:** Choose and set up resources and tools for AI model development, deployment, and usage.

### Levels 3 - 5: AI Model Optimization, Automation, and Scaling
Advanced workshops guide customized AI solution development for individual use cases, preparing them for productive use and full automation.

**Topics include:**

- **Adapting Open Source Models:** Adapt open source AI models to specific needs. Train and optimize for effective results with minimal resources.
- **Automated MLOps Pipelines:** Develop automated pipelines for AI model management, covering data flows, training, validation, and deployment for scalable development.
- **Transition to Production Environments:** Integrate trained AI models into production. Validate and manage models, enabling efficient inference and monitoring.
