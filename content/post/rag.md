# Workshop: Building a Retrieval Augmented Generation System

## Overview
On February 07, 2024 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. we offer the free AI workshop "Local RAG System" on site at HPI in Potsdam. 

During this workshop, you'll gain practical experience with embeddings, vector databases, and local Large Language Models (LLMs). By the end, you'll have a better understanding of the required components for Retrieval Augmented Generation and how to harness these tools to implement a system that understands and queries you own documents using a language model. 

## Audience

This hands-on workshop on implementing a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system to efficiently query and retrieve information from your local documents is aimed at all interested AI enthusiasts, data scientists and machine learning engineers with basic knowledge of Python and math.

## Language
The workshop will be taught in both English and German (working knowledge of either is sufficient).

## Registration
