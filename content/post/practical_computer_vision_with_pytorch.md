Would you like to learn how to build computer vision projects?


This event is for AI enthusiasts who are eager to delve into the practical aspects of computer vision using PyTorch. We will learn how to build and deploy neural networks for image classification. 

## Details
- We recommend joining the AI Maker Community Slack workspace before the workshop to engage in discussions with other participants. You can join us at [https://join.aimaker.community/](https://join.aimaker.community/).
- Participants will need to have a Google account and be familiar with Python, as this will be a practical exploration using Kaggle Notebooks. We encourage you to create an account on Kaggle and [to verify it](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/9883), so that you can acccess the GPUs on the platform.
- You will need an account on [Weights and Biases](www.wandb.ai) to do experiment tracking. Please create it before coming to the workshop.
- In the second part of the workshop, we will deploy a computer vision vision endpoint on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run?hl=en)
- The event will be hybrid, taking place both online and at our physical location: [Marchstrasse 23, 10587, Berlin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/CcSr8YxqSDqR4D1C9), Room 6.051.
- The workshop will happen on Tuesday 18th of June at 18:00 CEST and Thursday 20th of June at 18:00 CEST. Each session will have a duration of 2 hours.

We encourage you to [join our Slack workspace](https://join.aimaker.community/) to discuss with other participants during the session.
