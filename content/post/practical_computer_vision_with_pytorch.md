We at AI Services @ HPI are excited to announce a workshop on Practical Computer Vision with PyTorch. This event is designed for data scientists, machine learning engineers, computer science students, and software engineers who are eager to delve into the practical aspects of computer vision using PyTorch.

Details:
- We recommend joining the AI Maker Community Slack channel before the workshop to engage in discussions with other participants. You can join us at https://join.aimaker.community/.
- Participants will need to have a Google account and be familiar with Python, as this will be a practical exploration using Kaggle Notebooks.
- The event will be hybrid, taking place both online and at our physical location: Marchstrasse 23, 10587, Berlin.
