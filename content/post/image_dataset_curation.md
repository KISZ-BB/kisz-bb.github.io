# Workshop: Image Dataset Curation – Art Recommendation System

## Overview

On January 22, 2024 from 10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. we offer the free workshop “Image Dataset Curation – Art Recommendation System” on site at HPI and online via Zoom.

Learn to build an art recommendation system using machine learning. The workshop covers:
- Ethical scraping of artwork images in the public domain
- Employing pretrained convolutional neural networks
- Exploring image embeddings with Resnet and PyTorch

This workshop is the first part of a series of six workshops on dataset curation and building art recommendation systems and lays the groundwork for the rest of them. 

## Audience
