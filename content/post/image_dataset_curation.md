# Workshop: Image Dataset Curation – Art Recommendation System

## Overview

On March 04, 2024 from 5:30 pm to 9 pm we offer the free workshop “Image Dataset Curation – Art Recommendation System” on site at HPI.

We'll explore dataset curation and state of the art models for image classification and image similarity.

Gain practical skills in image analysis and machine learning, including:

- Interpreting the results of classification from neural networks with Class Activation Mapping
- OpenAI's CLIP for Zero-shot Classification
- Using image embeddings and Cleanlab to curate a dataset

This workshop is part four of a series of six workshops on image dataset curation
